# COPYRIGHT NON-ASSERTION DECLARATION VERSION 1.0

Copyright [Year] [Copyright Holder Name]. All Rights Reserved.

## CANONICAL TEXT

The following twelve (12) words constitute the complete and authoritative Copyright Non-Assertion Declaration:

```
USE / COPY / MODIFY IT HOWEVER YOU WANT.
NO WARRANTIES, LIABILITIES, AND PATENTS.
```

This legal verbose version possesses equivalent legal effect and validity as the above canonical text. Both versions constitute equally binding and enforceable instruments. The verbose version provides additional legal specificity for jurisdictions requiring extended documentation, whilst the canonical text remains legally complete and sufficient.

## PREAMBLE

This document provides legal elaboration of the Copyright Non-Assertion Declaration (CNAD), a maximally permissive approach to intellectual property that operates through non-assertion rather than traditional licensing. The Copyright Holder exercises their fundamental right to NOT assert copyright claims, a right that no legal system prohibits.

## DEFINITIONS

1. **"The Work"**: Any copyrightable material to which the CNAD has been applied.

2. **"Copyright Holder"**: The party or parties holding copyright who choose to apply this Declaration.

3. **"You"**: Any entity exercising rights with respect to The Work.

## LEGAL ELABORATION OF CANONICAL TEXT

### Part 1: "USE / COPY / MODIFY IT HOWEVER YOU WANT"

The Copyright Holder hereby declares non-assertion of any copyright claims regarding:

**USE**: You may employ The Work for any purpose—commercial, non-commercial, educational, personal, experimental, or any purpose not yet conceived. No use is prohibited or restricted.

**COPY**: You may reproduce The Work in any quantity, by any method, in any medium, for any duration. This includes but is not limited to digital reproduction, physical reproduction, partial reproduction, and reproduction with or without attribution.

**MODIFY**: You may alter, transform, translate, extend, reduce, combine, separate, or otherwise modify The Work without limitation. You may create derivative works freely and without restriction.

**HOWEVER YOU WANT**: This phrase confirms absolute discretion in Your exercise of the above rights, free from any conditions, restrictions, or requirements.

### Part 2: "NO WARRANTIES, LIABILITIES, AND PATENTS"

**NO WARRANTIES**: The Work is provided entirely without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, completeness, or performance. The Copyright Holder makes no representations about the suitability of The Work for any purpose.

**NO LIABILITIES**: The Copyright Holder shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever arising from or related to The Work or its use, including but not limited to direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

**NO PATENTS**: The Copyright Holder shall not assert any patent claims against any party for use of The Work, including but not limited to patents on methods, processes, algorithms, or implementations contained within The Work. The Copyright Holder makes no representations about The Work's freedom from third-party patent claims. Users retain all rights to defend their own patents if infringed by The Work or its derivatives.

## ACCEPTANCE AND TERMINATION

**Acceptance**: No acceptance is required. The Copyright Holder's non-assertion is unilateral and unconditional.

**Practical Permanence**: The Copyright Holder may formally revoke this Declaration, but acknowledges that upon public release, The Work proliferates beyond practical retrieval. Any purported revocation cannot affect copies already in circulation, rendering this non-assertion effectively permanent through practical impossibility rather than legal prohibition.

## VALIDITY

THIS TEXT CANNOT BE UNRECOGNISED NOR BE INVALID; NO LAW COMPELS COPYRIGHT ENFORCEMENT.

## GOVERNING PRINCIPLE

This Declaration is governed by the principle that copyright holders have the absolute right to NOT enforce their rights—a freedom that exists in every legal system. No law compels a copyright holder to assert their rights.

## APPLICATION

To effectuate the CNAD, parties may employ either:

**Direct Inclusion of Canonical Version:**
```
USE / COPY / MODIFY IT HOWEVER YOU WANT.
NO WARRANTIES, LIABILITIES, AND PATENTS.
```

**Direct Inclusion of Verbose Version:**
[Include the full text of this document]

**Reference to Either Version:**
```
This work is released under the Copyright Non-Assertion Declaration (CNAD).
Full text available at: [URL]
```

All methods constitute legally sufficient notice of the Copyright Holder's declaration.

## DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DECLARATION

Both the canonical CNAD text and this verbose version are themselves released under the Copyright Non-Assertion Declaration. Any party may use, copy, modify, or distribute these texts without restriction, warranty, liability, or patent claims.
